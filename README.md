1. Customer Churn Analysis 

1.1 Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a customer churn dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

1.2 Cleaned and preprocessed data by handling missing values, converting data types, and binning continuous variables into tenure groups.
   
1.3 Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to identify key predictors of churn, such as payment method, contract type, and tenure duration,
   Achieved actionable insights by transforming categorical data for churn prediction (binary conversion: Yes = 1, No = 0).

1.4 Visualized customer behavior trends with custom plots, improving understanding of churn distribution by demographic and payment factors.

   
2. Quantifiable Achievements
   
2.1 Analyzed over 7,000 customer records for insights into churn trends and correlations with demographic and payment behaviors.

2.2 Identified that tenure groups of 0-12 months had the highest churn rate, providing critical insights for business retention strategies,
    Reduced data redundancy by removing non-essential columns and optimized datasets for efficient processing.
